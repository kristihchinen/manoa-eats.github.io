To do this, you’ll need to create a repo within the manoa-music organization called “manoa-music.github.io”, and then create an index.md file within it with the contents of your home page in markdown format. For example, see the bowfolios.github.io repository [https://github.com/bowfolios/bowfolios.github.io].
